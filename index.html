        <p>Hi!</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        My name is Sascha and this is where I live on the Internet.
        My main activity in life is thinking; at the moment I spend most of my thinking time working for <a href="http://www.zuehlke.com" target="_blank">ZÃ¼hlke</a>, which is fun.
        Not too long ago I traveled on my motorcycle to/through West Africa.
        You can read about it <a href="https://saschaeglau.com/travel/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I do various other stuff on the internet and elsewhere:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I put code on <a href="https://github.com/tmlye" target="_blank">github</a>
        <li>I track my reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16170125-sascha-eglau" target="_blank">goodreads</a>. For non-fiction books, I sometimes write <a href="https://saschaeglau.com/book-reports/">book reports</a></li>
        <li>I'm also on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/saschaeglau" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
        <li>For a more formal presentation, you can take a look at my <a href="https://saschaeglau.com/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">r&#233;sum&#233;</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>On a more personal level:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem solving, climate change and exploring other cultures are my main interests</li>
        <li>So far, I've called places in 5 different countries my home</li>
        <li>My strongest believe is that each individual has the responsibility for giving meaning to his own life. Turning off autopilot and making conscious decisions makes the difference between a dull, boring life and a happy, fulfilling one. You are the sum of all your decisions -- make sure they are your own.</li>
        <li>I own less than 100 things</li>
        <li>My favorite passtime is to go where I've never been</li>
        <li>What keeps me going is, in its purest form, a constant drive for knowledge and personal development</li>
        <li>I like bulleted lists</li>
    </ul>
